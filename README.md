## Salut!

I'm Bob Davidson, Director of Development at [Blend Interactive](https://www.blendinteractive.com/), father of two, husband of one, friend to many. I work primarily on the web, leading a team of developers focused on building large, content-managed websites. I mostly work in Optimizely and Umbraco, but have started to dabble in headless.

### Repositories

Here's some stuff I've built that I just think is neat:

* [2B2D](https://github.com/mrdrbob/2b2d) - My home-grown Typescript and WebGPU game engine. I wanted to know how GPU works, so obviously I built a game engine.
* [bobdavidson.dev](https://github.com/mrdrbob/bobdavidson.dev) - My ever-neglected website. Only of interest if you're curious how I build and deploy a custom static site with Gulp and Twig.
* [cms12-from-scratch](https://github.com/mrdrbob/cms12-from-scratch) - The Git repository for my [video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEEGLP10s_W1uf9OpjGDAIhXcRTswsZ33) on building an Optimizely CMS12 site from scratch.
* [PageOfBob.Parsing.Compiled](https://github.com/mrdrbob/PageOfBob.Parsing.Compiled) - My C# parsing library. You write parsers in a C#-based DSL, which are then compiled to bytecode at runtime.
* [Blend.Datastore](https://github.com/blendinteractive/Blend.Datastore) - A minimalist SQL migration system and access pattern, for when Entity Framework is too much, and Dapper is too little. 
* [Blend.Html.Lexer](https://github.com/blendinteractive/Blend.Html.Lexer) - A library for lexing/parsing HTML, designed for cleaning and transforming HTML while tolerating and even preserving malformed HTML.

### /Now

* I'm currently dipping my toes into headless, starting with SvelteKit and Typescript against an GraphQL backend.
* I write and record music as a hobby. In fact, I wrote and recorded the intro / outro music to my Youtube videos. I plan to write/record at least one new song in 2025.
* I'm learning French. I can read somewhere between an A1 and A2 fluency level. _(Just don't ask me to speak or understand spoken French)_
